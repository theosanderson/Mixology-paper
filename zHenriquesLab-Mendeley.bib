  abstractNote = {The way life scientists communicate has hardly changed since the days of Gregor Mendel. Even though mobile and Internet technology has transformed a wide array of communication channels,  academic publishing has largely resisted change. As a consequence,  it is impossible to stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving methodology in the life sciences. Most corrections and optimizations of previously-published methods are never properly communicated beyond the confines of a given laboratory. Researchers are constantly re-discovering knowledge simply due to the lack of an efficient system to communicate such findings. Protocols.io is a central platform that leverages modern web and mobile technology to facilitate easy discovery and sharing of this scientific knowledge.},

	Abstract = {ChEBI is a database and ontology containing information about chemical entities of biological interest. It currently includes over 46,000 entries, each of which is classified within the ontology and assigned multiple annotations including (where relevant) a chemical structure, database cross-references, synonyms and literature citations. All content is freely available and can be accessed online at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi. In this update paper, we describe recent improvements and additions to the ChEBI offering. We have substantially extended our collection of endogenous metabolites for several organisms including human, mouse, Escherichia coli and yeast. Our front-end has also been reworked and updated, improving the user experience, removing our dependency on Java applets in favour of embedded JavaScript components and moving from a monthly release update to a 'live' website. Programmatic access has been improved by the introduction of a library, libChEBI, in Java, Python and Matlab. Furthermore, we have added two new tools, namely an analysis tool, BiNChE, and a query tool for the ontology, OntoQuery.},
