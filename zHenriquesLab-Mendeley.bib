  abstractNote = {The way life scientists communicate has hardly changed since the days of Gregor Mendel. Even though mobile and Internet technology has transformed a wide array of communication channels,  academic publishing has largely resisted change. As a consequence,  it is impossible to stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving methodology in the life sciences. Most corrections and optimizations of previously-published methods are never properly communicated beyond the confines of a given laboratory. Researchers are constantly re-discovering knowledge simply due to the lack of an efficient system to communicate such findings. Protocols.io is a central platform that leverages modern web and mobile technology to facilitate easy discovery and sharing of this scientific knowledge.},
